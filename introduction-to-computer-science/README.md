# CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science

This repository contains my solutions and projects for the problem sets from Harvard University's CS50 course. CS50 is an introduction to computer science and programming, suitable for both concentrators and non-concentrators, regardless of prior programming experience.

## About CS50

CS50 covers a wide range of topics, including:

- Computational thinking and problem-solving.
- Abstraction and algorithms.
- Data structures and their implementation.
- Introduction to programming languages like C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Understanding the fundamental concepts of computer science.

Throughout the course, you will work on problem sets inspired by various fields, including arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. The problem sets will challenge you to think critically, design solutions, and write code that adheres to good programming practices.

## Structure of This Repository

Each problem set will have its own folder within this repository. In each folder, you will find my solutions, code files, and any related resources for that specific problem set.
