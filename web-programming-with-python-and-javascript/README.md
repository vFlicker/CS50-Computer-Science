# CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This repository contains my solutions and projects for the CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course offered by Harvard University. This course builds upon the foundation laid by CS50, delving deeper into the design and implementation of web applications using Python, JavaScript, and SQL. It covers various frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap to create feature-rich web applications.

## About CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Topics covered in this course include:

- Database design.
- Scalability.
- Security.
- User experience.
- Building and using APIs.
- Creating interactive user interfaces.
- Leveraging cloud services like GitHub and Heroku.
- Designing and deploying web applications on the Internet.

Through a series of hands-on projects, you'll gain experience in these principles, languages, and tools to develop and deploy web applications effectively.

## Projects

Here's an overview of the projects in this course, along with their descriptions:

- [Project 0 - Google Search](project-0/): Design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search. This project involves creating web pages for searching, linking, and displaying search results, closely resembling Google's aesthetics.
- [Project 1 - Wiki](project-1/): Design a Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia. This project requires building a web application for creating, searching, and viewing encyclopedia entries, as well as editing and saving new entries.
- [Project 2 - Auction](project-2/): Create an eBay-like e-commerce auction site. This project involves building a platform for users to post auction listings, place bids, comment on listings, and manage their watchlist.
- [Project 3 - Email](project-3/): Design a front-end for an email client that interacts with an API to send and receive emails. This project includes features like sending emails, viewing mailbox contents, marking emails as read or unread, and replying to emails.
- [Project 4 - Social Network](project-4/): Create a Twitter-like social network website. This project focuses on allowing users to make posts, follow other users, "like" posts, and navigate through posts and profiles.

Each project is a practical application of the concepts learned in the course and offers hands-on experience in web development with Python and JavaScript.
